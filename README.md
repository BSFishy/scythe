Scythe is a library and tool set for creating applications with Rust.
Its main goal is to make it easier to do some common tasks with applications, such as storing data and installation.

## Status

Scythe is still early in development.
While some features are stable and can be used in production, Scythe won't be considered "stable" until all features are stable.
